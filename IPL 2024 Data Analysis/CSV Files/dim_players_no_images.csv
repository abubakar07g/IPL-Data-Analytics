Travis Head,SRH,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"A talented, aggressive left-hand batter earmarked for big things at a young age, it was Travis Head's second coming as an international cricketer where his career really took off. In late 2021 he was recalled for the Ashes series and made a match-defining 85-ball century at the Gabba - it set the tone for a strong of destructive Test innings while he also reemerged as a white-ball force, so central to Australia's 2023 ODI World Cup plans that they waited for him to recover from a broken hand. In the final against India he made 137 off 120 balls. A cult hero was born."
Rahul Tripathi,SRH,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"A technically correct middle-order batter, Rahul Tripathi came to the game in the footsteps of his father, an army man who in his time turned out for Uttar Pradesh in junior cricket and also played at university level. "
Aiden Markram,SRH,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Opening Batter,"The first South Africa captain to win a World Cup, albeit at age-group level, Aiden Markram announced himself as champion material early. He led South Africa's Under-19s to World Cup glory in 2014 and was also their leading run-scorer and third overall. It took him another three years to break into the senior side, but when he did, he made an impact right away with 97, 143 and 125 in his first three Tests, at home against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. "
Nitish Kumar Reddy,SRH,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Batting Allrounder,"Nitish Kumar Reddy first made headlines when he started the 2017-18 Vijay Merchant Trophy with a triple-century for Andhra, followed by a 345-ball 441 against Nagaland. His 1237 runs there at an average of 176.41 still remains the record highest tally in the tournament's history, and earned him the BCCI's award for best U-16 cricketer that season. As he developed his bowling as a seamer, he also took the new ball for Andhra in senior domestic cricket, and his all-round skills earned the interest of Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL. Before the 2023 IPL season, he was bought by SRH for INR 20 lakhs, but in his debut season, bowled five wicketless overs across two games while not getting to bat. However, in IPL 2024, his exploits earned SRH crucial victories in their run to the playoffs; his 64 against PBKS helped SRH win by one run, while his unbeaten 76 against Delhi Capitals ensured a two-run win.

Heinrich Klaasen,SRH,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A wicketkeeper-batter known for his belligerent six-hitting, Heinrich Klaasen first got his chance in the South African team as an injury replacement, opening in place of Quinton de Kock, but went on to establish himself in the middle order in limited-overs cricket. "
Shahbaz Ahmed,SRH,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"Shahbaz Ahmed was born in Mewat, Haryana, the most backward district in India according to a government report in 2018. He started as a batter, playing local cricket in and around Mewat, but the opportunities were limited. In 2015, he moved to Kolkata to try his luck in club cricket. That is where he developed his left-arm spin and transformed himself into an allrounder."

Bhuvneshwar Kumar,SRH,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"At the time of his India debut in 2012, Bhuvneshwar Kumar seemed the answer to the side's fast-bowling scarcity; though middling in pace, he produced swing both ways and had a devastating inswinger. In his first T20I over, he bowled Nasir Jamshed; with his first ODI delivery, he bowled Mohammad Hafeez; and in his first Test series he played a part in India's first whitewash win in a four-Test series, against Australia in 2013.Â "

Venkatesh Iyer,KKR,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"A loose-limbed and tall pace-bowling allrounder, Venkatesh Iyer was briefly a much sought-after player in white-ball cricket for India.

Harshit Rana,KKR,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"A fast bowler from Delhi, Harshit Rana is among the modern breed of players who made their IPL debut before their senior domestic debut. In his case, it was thanks to Kolkata Knight Riders' scouting system. With height, pace, hit-the-deck skills and clever variations to his credit, Harshit was fast-tracked into the India squad in July 2024, after having won the IPL with KKR."
Andre Russell,KKR,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Allrounder,
Phil Salt,KKR,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Phil Salt's fearless ball-striking at the top of the Sussex order earned him attention from across the global T20 circuit and a maiden England call-up in 2019, though he was made to wait until 2021 for his debut when he performed a passable impression of Jason Roy in the Covid-hit ODI series against Pakistan."

Rinku Singh,KKR,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"A middle-order batter and an excellent outfielder, Rinku Singh stunned everyone when he hit Yash Dayal for five consecutive sixes with Kolkata Knight Riders needing 28 from five balls against Gujarat Titans in IPL 2023."

His big hitting as a 19-year-old in his debut IPL season, in 2015, earned with the nickname ""Hurricane Hooda"", but more importantly, got him a Rs 4.2 crore (US$ 622,000 approx) contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad at the next auction.

Matt Henry,LSG,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"A slippery fast bowler, Matt Henry almost didn't play for New Zealand, as he underwent a major back surgery in 2012. Two years later, though, he was called up as cover during the ODI series against India, and thanks to a niggle to fellow injury-prone Hamish Bennett, Henry put the black cap on and registered the third-best figures for a New Zealand debutant in ODIs, claiming four wickets to seal New Zealand's 4-0 series triumph."
Naveen-ul-Haq,LSG,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,"A feisty fast bowler with a wide range of slower-ball variations, Naveen-ul-Haq first rose to prominence as a death-overs specialist, but soon developed his new-ball skills to become a useful weapon across phases. Like many of his compatriots, he is an in-demand commodity in franchise leagues across the world.
Born in Kabul, Naveen fled with his family to Pakistan in his early years, and began playing tape-ball cricket there. When they returned to Afghanistan, he began playing with a leather ball for the first time. He was so impressive for Afghanistan's Under-16 and Under-19 teams that his first professional match at the senior level was his ODI debut against Bangladesh, just two days after he turned 17.
Naveen made seven sporadic ODI appearances from his debut to January 2021, and a year later he took a break from the format to focus on the 2022 T20 World Cup. In the meantime, he became an integral part of Afghanistan's T20I side, either side of captaining Afghanistan to a fourth-place finish at the 2018 Under-19 World Cup.
Stints at the BPL, CPL, LPL and the T20 Blast followed as he began to build his reputation. In 2023, Naveen announced he would retire from ODIs after the World Cup that year. He took eight wickets as Afghanistan put in an impressive display in the competition, finishing sixth on the table.
By then, he had made his IPL debut as well, taking 11 wickets in his first season for Lucknow Super Giants, and was also in the news for an on-field altercation with Virat Kohli.
Towards the end of 2024, Naveen along with team-mates Fazalhaq Farooqi and Mujeeb-ur-Rahman got in trouble with the Afghanistan Cricket Board after they asked to be released from their central contracts so they could sign up for more franchise leagues. The board responded by revoking the players' NOCs and denying them further NOCs for the next two years. The situation was resolved with the board agreeing to grant them a limited number of NOCs and slapping them with financial penalties.
Naveen returned 14 wickets in IPL 2024, but it was in the T20 World Cup that year that he really shone. Naveen and Farooqi combined to take the spotlight away from Afghanistan's spinners as they made the semi-finals of a World Cup for the first time. Naveen finished the tournament with 13 wickets, and his three-wicket burst was one of the highlights of Afghanistan's first-ever victory over Australia in any format."

Will Jacks,RCB,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"It was a quirk of circumstance that Will Jacks' first standout performance as an England player was a six-wicket haul in a Test match rather than a characteristically dominant white-ball innings. Jacks became the first England debutant spinner since 1993 to claim a five-for on Test debut in 2022, setting up a famous win in Rawalpindi. Not only was it his maiden first-class five-for, he was not even meant to be in the side: he was a late change to the side before the toss with Ben Foakes ruled out through illness."
Mohammed Siraj,RCB,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Mohammed Siraj's rise as a seamer was remarkably swift. The son of an autorickshaw driver in Hyderabad, he only began playing the game in class seven. It was in 2015 that he first bowled with a cricket ball. In 2017, he bagged an IPL contract worth INR 2.6 crore. Months later, he was wearing an India shirt and bowling in a T20 international against New Zealand. "
Cameron Green,RCB,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Batting Allrounder,"Cameron Green was earmarked as an international cricket from very early. Contracted to Western Australia as a schoolboy, he took 5 for 24 on first-class debut against Tasmania in February 2017 as a 17-year-old. He was selected initially for his bowling given his 200cm frame and his ability to deliver fast outswing but was plagued by stress fractures. However, throughout his junior days with Subiaco-Floreat and WA's junior teams his technically sound batting and an unquenchable thirst for scoring runs saw him emerge as a genuine allrounder of rare ability.

It was the highest amount earned by a domestic uncapped player in the auction, and was reward for a solid season with Sunrisers in 2013, when he grabbed 11 wickets in 13 matches at an economy rate of 6.60. He formed a potent combination with India legspinner Amit Mishra as Sunrisers beat expectations to reach the semi-finals in their first season."

Mohit Sharma,GT,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"Although Mohit Sharma burst onto the domestic scene during Haryana's best Ranji Trophy season in 2011-12, he made his own headlines a year later. In his debut season Mohit had played just three matches when Haryana made an impressive run to the semi-finals, but during the 2012-13 Ranji season he emerged as one of the best fast bowlers in the country, finishing as the fifth-highest wicket-taker. Despite that, not many had seen or known about the youngster from Faridabad, who had been on the fringes ever since he rose through age-group cricket camps organised by the Haryana Cricket Association. "
Swapnil Singh,RCB,Right hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,"Swapnil Singh's career has been a rollercoaster. The left-arm-spin-bowling allrounder was part of India's 25 probables for the 2008 Under-19 World Cup, but ultimately did not make the squad for Malaysia. However, he made his first-class debut for Baroda at the age of 14 years and 355 days. Over the next ten years, he played just 76 domestic matches, of which 31 came during the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons. Swapnil claimed 6 for 19, the second-best bowling figures in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament, and was later bought for INR 10 lakhs by the erstwhile Kings XI Punjab (now PBKS) at the 2016 IPL auction. Under Glenn Maxwell's captaincy at PBKS, he made his IPL debut, with a maiden wicket of MS Dhoni. Later, he was with Lucknow Super Giants during IPL 2023, while in IPL 2024, Swapnil played six league games with his new team Royal Challengers Bengaluru. His tidy bowling helped RCB win their last six matches to qualify for the playoffs. Domestically, Swapnil has moved from Baroda to Uttarakhand.

One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India.

Sandeep Sharma,RR,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"A right-arm medium pacer in the Praveen Kumar mould, Sandeep Sharma is an accurate bowler, capable of swinging the ball and sending down economical spells. Sandeep, who began as a batsman for his school in Patiala before his coach persuaded him to take up bowling seriously, was part of India's Under-19 squad for the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand. He came into his own in the same event two years later, in Australia, where he took four wickets in the final, against the hosts, and finished as the joint-highest wicket-taker for India (12). As a result, Sandeep was signed by Kings XI Punjab ahead of the 2013 season. In three seasons for his franchise, Sandeep not only took 39 wickets, but was regularly employed by his captain George Bailey to bowl the death overs. Sandeep was soon drafted into India's T20 side for the two-match series against Zimbabwe in 2015, where he failed to deliver. In 2014, however, Sandeep suffered a stress fracture of the back that kept him out of competitive cricket for five months. He returned strongly to claim 28 scalps in the 2014-15 Ranji Trophy, the most for his side.  ESPNcricinfo Staff"
